## General info

This project is a responsive simple weather info giving website project. This is my first project where I have used API key first time after successfully learning. 

## Features

In this project, I have used the Openweathermap.com API key in order to inherit the information regarding the temperature, location and the time zone. I have also ussed the skycons icons to express the current weather type and most importantly, to make the website more interesting. 

## Technologies

The project is mainly created with:

* JavaScript ES6
* HTML 5
* CSS 3
