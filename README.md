## General info

This project is a responsive simple weather info giving website.

## Features

Initially, the starter project had some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. It has been converted from a static project to an interactive one using JavaScript ES6:

Navigation menu is built dynamically as an unordered list.

It is clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page. This can be recognized by watching the class "your-active-class" moving to the section which is under consideration on browser developer tools as well as the class 'active' in the corresponding nav items.

If you click an item from the navigation menu, the link scrolls smoothly to the appropriate section. Moreover, it also includes a collapsible navigation bar for smaller devices such as smartphones.

## Technologies

The project is mainly created with:

* JavaScript ES6
* HTML 5
* CSS 3
